# Thermodynamic Particle Simulation

This open-source project simulates particle interactions using Extropic's THRML library, showcasing thermodynamic computing for efficient, realistic physics.

## Why?
Traditional sims are power-hungry. Thermodynamic computing uses noise for probabilistic efficiency (10,000x less energy per arXiv paper).

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run: `python particle_sim_2d.py`

## Demo
Watch particles interact!
